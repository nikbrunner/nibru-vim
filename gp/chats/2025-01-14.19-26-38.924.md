# AWDCS

A scope-based keymap system that brings simplicity and clarity to modal editor configurations through mindful organization and purposeful design.

## Philosophy

Traditional modal editor keymaps typically organize bindings by tool or function.

This system takes a different approach by organizing mappings based on their scope of operation:

```
<Scope><?Group?><Operation>
```

- **[A]pp** (`<leader>a`) - Application-level operations
- **[W]orkspace** (`<leader>w`) - Operations affecting the entire workspace
- **[D]ocument** (`<leader>d`) - Operations on the current document
- **[C]hange** (`<leader>c`) - Operations on a change (Hunk)
- **[S]ymbol** (`<leader>s`) - Operations on code symbols

## Design Principles

- **Scope First**
  - Every operation must clearly belong to a specific scope (workspace, document, symbol)
  - The scope should be immediately obvious from the operation's nature
- **Semantic Operations**
  - Mappings should represent clear, meaningful operations
  - Focus on frequently used operations that benefit from quick access
  - Focus on what the operation means, not how it's implemented
- **Tool & Editor Agnostic**:
  - Mappings should be independent of specific tools or editors
  - Use semantic terms (e.g., 'History' instead of 'Git')
  - Implementation details are left to the user's configuration
- **Preserve Editor Defaults**:
  - Don't replace basic editor operations with custom mappings
  - Focus on operations that enhance rather than replace core functionality
  - Leave common editor commands in their traditional form
- **Consistent Patterns**:
  - Second key should relate to the action within the scope
  - Related operations should share the same scope
  - Maintain predictable patterns across all mappings
- **Single Source**:
  - Each operation should have exactly one mapping
  - Avoid duplicate mappings across different key combinations
  - Choose the most appropriate and efficient mapping location

## Leader Key

I personally use (and recommend) `,` as my leader key, but you can use any key you like.
This way we use both hands in combination when typing the keymaps, which reduces strain by balancing the workload on the fingers.
Also I find that the the middle finger is faster than the thumb, which is generally a good thing, but also very nice to quickly double tap the leader key, to reach the command mode.

## Keymap

### `<leader><leader>` - Global

This is a little bit of a special case, as it's not really a keymap, but a global command.
This is an alternative way to quickly enter the command mode (same as `:`), which lends to increased direct usage of the builtin commands without mapping them.

Since I am using home row mods (really bottom row mods.. See my layout [here](https://github.com/nikbrunner/koyo>), I sometimes get missfires for quickly typing `:`.
When quickly dobule tapping the leader key, I quickly and safely reach the command mode, without worrying about typos.

This is of course just personal preference.

For example in Neovim you can create a mapping like so:

```lua
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "x" }, "<leader><leader>", function()
    vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(":", "n", true)
end, { desc = "Command Mode" })
```

Hi there. This is a keymap project for myself. this is the README file. I want you to assist me to brainstorm about it and so on.

What do you think? I am thinking about removing the leader key from the symbol group

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
This is a well-thought-out and organized keymap system! Let's analyze it and discuss some points:

1. About removing leader from symbol operations:
This could make sense because symbol operations are very frequent actions. However, consider:

Pros of removing leader:
- Faster access to common operations
- Reduces keystrokes for frequent actions
- More aligned with vim's philosophy of quick editing

Cons of removing leader:
- Breaks the consistency of the scope-based system
- Might conflict with existing vim mappings
- Could make the system harder to remember ("why do symbol operations not have a leader?")

2. General observations:
- The scope-based organization is very clean and logical
- The mnemonic structure (first letter matching the action) makes it easy to remember
- There's good separation of concerns between different scopes

3. Potential improvements:
- Consider adding a new scope for text objects/blocks (`<leader>b`?)
- Maybe add a scope for testing operations (`<leader>t`?)
- Could add a navigation scope (`<leader>n`?) for jump lists, marks, etc.

4. Alternative for symbol operations:
Instead of removing the leader, you could consider:
- Using `g` prefix (vim's goto prefix) for symbol operations
- Creating a hybrid system where critical symbol operations have both leader and non-leader mappings
- Using a different modifier key for symbol operations

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points? Or would you like to explore a specific aspect further?


ðŸ’¬:
Yeah you have some good points here. I was also used to using two key operations in vim like `gd` or `gr` for symbol like actions, but honestly, while `go to definition` is free by accident and fits the mnemonic, its rather by accident.

I had the idea of organizing the keymaps by scope. Make it more intentional. With this I worked on AWDCS.

I am pretty happy with the groups so far- BUT i am also used to the two key operations for symbols, and it is most often used keybindings.
To be clear I am only talking about the 2 key strokes that I am used to for symbol interactions. So typing `sd` or `sr` is great. It breaks consistency, but its faster. I am used to two keys.

```lua
map("n", "s", "<Nop>")
```

Thats why I considered removing the leader key from the symbol group, but yeah It breaks the consistency. I don't know if its worth it.

While I always create "products" like this, like they could be for everybody, its mainly for myself. I don't think anybody would be interrested in this. I am probably overthinking this.

I have the following from nvim/lua/nbr/keymaps.lua:

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
I see your point. For personal use, if you're used to two-key symbol operations and find them more efficient, it might make sense to break consistency for practicality.

Let's analyze your thinking process:

1. The core idea is great: organizing by scope makes keymaps more intentional and logical
2. Symbol operations are special because:
   - They're very frequently used
   - Two-key combinations feel natural for them
   - Historical muscle memory from vim (`gd`, `gr`, etc.)

You could consider a hybrid approach:

```lua
-- Primary symbol mappings (quick, two-key)
vim.keymap.set("n", "sd", function() -- symbol definition
    -- implementation
end, { desc = "Symbol Definition" })

-- Alternative with leader (for consistency)
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>sd", function() -- same as above
    -- implementation
end, { desc = "Symbol Definition" })
```

This way you:
- Keep your preferred quick access with two keys
- Maintain system consistency by also having leader versions
- Don't have to choose between speed and consistency

About overthinking:
1. Even if it's just for you, having a well-thought-out system:
   - Makes maintenance easier
   - Helps you remember mappings
   - Could inspire others if shared

Would you like to see the keymaps file you mentioned? That might help us discuss more specific implementation details.


ðŸ’¬:
Yeah we could define always to mappings (with leader and without) but this would also go against the core principle to not have two bindigns for one purpose. I would rather not do that. I am unsure. ðŸ˜”

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
You make a very good point - having dual mappings would indeed violate your "Single Source" design principle:

> **Single Source**:
> - Each operation should have exactly one mapping
> - Avoid duplicate mappings across different key combinations
> - Choose the most appropriate and efficient mapping location

This is actually a classic design tension:
- Principle vs Practicality
- Consistency vs Efficiency
- System purity vs User experience

Given that this is primarily for your use, I'd suggest asking yourself:

1. Which causes more mental friction:
   - Breaking the consistency of the scope-based system?
   - Having to use three keystrokes (leader + two keys) for frequent symbol operations?

2. What's more valuable to you:
   - The elegance of a consistent system?
   - The efficiency of faster symbol operations?

If you decide to break consistency for symbol operations, you could document it as an intentional exception:

```markdown
### Symbol Operations Exception
While most operations follow the `<leader><scope><action>` pattern, symbol operations
are accessed directly with `<scope><action>` due to their high frequency of use.
This is an intentional deviation from the pattern to optimize for efficiency.
```

Sometimes the best design acknowledges and documents its exceptions rather than forcing consistency at all costs.

What are your thoughts on framing it this way?


ðŸ’¬:
Yeah I think I will do that. Lets make an exception and also document it. I just tested it quickly to adapt this system to the Zed editor. It works pretty well.

Nice! I see you've already implemented the symbol operations without leader in Zed (`sd`, `sr`, `si`, `sn`). This looks clean and practical. 

Let's document this exception in your README. I'll propose a modification to the Symbol section:

```markdown
### `s` - [S]ymbol

> **Note:** Unlike other scopes, symbol operations do not use the leader key due to their high frequency of use. 
> This intentional exception optimizes for efficiency while maintaining the semantic meaning of the scope.

| Shortcut | Label                 | Description                 | Notes             |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `sd`     | `S`ymbol `D`efinition | Go to symbol definition     |
| `sr`     | `S`ymbol `R`eferences | Show symbol references      |
| `sa`     | `S`ymbol `A`ctions    | Show symbol actions         |
| `sh`     | `S`ymbol `H`istory    | Show blame information      |
| `sn`     | `S`ymbol `N`ame       | Rename symbol               |
| `sl`     | `S`ymbol `L`log       | Insert log for symbol       |
| `si`     | `S`ymbol `I`nfo       | Show symbol information     | Hover Information |
| `sI`     | `S`ymbol `I`nspect    | Inspect symbol under cursor |
```

Also, looking at your Zed configuration, I notice you've maintained good consistency across editors while adapting to Zed's specific features. For example:
- Using `, ,` for command mode
- Maintaining the AWDCS structure
- Adapting the system to Zed's specific features while keeping the core philosophy

Would you like to add any specific notes about editor-specific adaptations to the README as well?


ðŸ’¬:
No not for now, but I am glad that adapting the agnostic keymap project to other editors is working well.

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Yes, it's a good validation of your "Tool & Editor Agnostic" design principle! The fact that you could transfer the AWDCS system to Zed while maintaining its core philosophy shows that:

1. The scope-based organization is truly editor-independent
2. The semantic approach (focusing on what operations do, not how they're implemented) works
3. The system is flexible enough to accommodate editor-specific features while maintaining consistency

The symbol operation exception also proved to be practically implementable across editors, which further validates your decision to break consistency for better efficiency in this specific case.

Would you like to:
- Work on implementing this in other editors?
- Further refine any aspects of the system?
- Add more scopes or operations?
- Or focus on something else?

I have the following from awdcs/README.md:

```markdown
# AWDCS

A scope-based keymap system that brings simplicity and clarity to modal editor configurations through mindful organization and purposeful design.

## Philosophy

Traditional modal editor keymaps typically organize bindings by tool or function.

This system takes a different approach by organizing mappings based on their scope of operation:

```
<Scope><?Group?><Operation>
```

- **[A]pp** (`<leader>a`) - Application-level operations
- **[W]orkspace** (`<leader>w`) - Operations affecting the entire workspace
- **[D]ocument** (`<leader>d`) - Operations on the current document
- **[C]hange** (`<leader>c`) - Operations on a change (Hunk)
- **[S]ymbol** (`s`) - Operations on code symbols

## Design Principles

- **Scope First**
  - Every operation must clearly belong to a specific scope (workspace, document, symbol)
  - The scope should be immediately obvious from the operation's nature
- **Semantic Operations**
  - Mappings should represent clear, meaningful operations
  - Focus on frequently used operations that benefit from quick access
  - Focus on what the operation means, not how it's implemented
- **Tool & Editor Agnostic**:
  - Mappings should be independent of specific tools or editors
  - Use semantic terms (e.g., 'History' instead of 'Git')
  - Implementation details are left to the user's configuration
- **Preserve Editor Defaults**:
  - Don't replace basic editor operations with custom mappings
  - Focus on operations that enhance rather than replace core functionality
  - Leave common editor commands in their traditional form
- **Consistent Patterns**:
  - Second key should relate to the action within the scope
  - Related operations should share the same scope
  - Maintain predictable patterns across all mappings
- **Single Source**:
  - Each operation should have exactly one mapping
  - Avoid duplicate mappings across different key combinations
  - Choose the most appropriate and efficient mapping location

## Leader Key

I personally use (and recommend) `,` as my leader key, but you can use any key you like.
This way we use both hands in combination when typing the keymaps, which reduces strain by balancing the workload on the fingers.
Also I find that the the middle finger is faster than the thumb, which is generally a good thing, but also very nice to quickly double tap the leader key, to reach the command mode.

## Keymap

### `<leader><leader>` - Global

This is a little bit of a special case, as it's not really a keymap, but a global command.
This is an alternative way to quickly enter the command mode (same as `:`), which lends to increased direct usage of the builtin commands without mapping them.

Since I am using home row mods (really bottom row mods.. See my layout [here](https://github.com/nikbrunner/koyo>), I sometimes get missfires for quickly typing `:`.
When quickly dobule tapping the leader key, I quickly and safely reach the command mode, without worrying about typos.

This is of course just personal preference.

For example in Neovim you can create a mapping like so:

```lua
vim.keymap.set({ "n", "x" }, "<leader><leader>", function()
    vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(":", "n", true)
end, { desc = "Command Mode" })
```

This is the current state.

I would like you to add a note that the bindings are ordered alphabetically. They are not ordred by importance or relevance.


Also what I noticed and should be mentioned somehow, that if we use the `,` leader key, and by using these mappings, the operations on the left hand side do really play into each other. `sa` is really close to each other, or `we` or `wd` and so on. There is probably a good way to formulate a sentence here with the right terminology.

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
I'll help add both points. For the ergonomic aspect, we can talk about "hand position optimization" or "finger travel efficiency". Here's a suggested addition after the Leader Key section:

```markdown
## Mapping Organization

### Alphabetical Order
All keybindings in each scope are listed alphabetically for easier reference and maintenance, not by frequency of use or importance.

### Ergonomic Design
When using `,` as the leader key, the system naturally creates efficient left-hand finger patterns. The scope key (first key after leader) and the operation key (second key) are often adjacent or nearby on the keyboard (e.g., `sa`, `we`, `wd`), minimizing finger travel and creating comfortable rolling motions for the left hand. This ergonomic benefit is a fortunate consequence of the alphabetical organization combined with the QWERTY layout's letter placement.
```

How does this sound? We could adjust the wording to be more technical or more casual, depending on your preference. We could also add specific examples of the finger patterns if you think that would be helpful.
